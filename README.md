# Distributed Systems + Rust (with C) - Expanded Roadmap

Welcome! This repo is designed to help you master systems-level concepts — distributed systems, databases, OS, and networking — while building confidence in Rust and C.

## 🧠 Focus Areas
- Distributed systems concepts and real-world architectures (Dynamo, Aurora, Raft, etc.)
- Storage engines, replication, concurrency control, and fault tolerance
- Low-level programming using Rust and C
- Tooling: tracing, profiling, debugging

## 🐢 Pacing (with buffers)
This roadmap assumes:
- ~5 hours/week max effort
- Buffer weeks every 3–4 learning weeks
- Real-life adjustments (job, family) baked in
