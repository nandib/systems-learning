# Distributed Systems + Rust Journey

This repo is a structured, self-paced roadmap for mastering distributed systems, database internals, and systems programming using both Rust and C.

## Why This Exists
- To bridge theory (papers, courses) with implementation (projects)
- To grow both safe modern systems skills (Rust) and low-level expertise (C)
- To support your journey into infra engineering, databases, or OSS systems
